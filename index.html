    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design the structure of web pages. It uses elements and tags to define content and layout.</p>

    <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of web pages. They are represented by tags, which are enclosed in angle brackets, such as <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> for headings or <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> for paragraphs.</p>

    <p>Using proper HTML structure ensures that web pages are accessible, maintainable, and compatible with different browsers and devices. It also helps search engines understand the content better.</p>

    <p>HTML is often used in conjunction with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.</p>
